    "## TensorFlow Static Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire purpose of Tensorflow is to have a so-called computational graph that can be executed much more efficiently than if the same calculations were to be performed directly in Python. TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed, while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to optimize the variables of the graph so as to make the model perform better. This is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule for derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also take advantage of multi-core CPUs as well as GPUs - and Google has even built special hardware accelerators just for TensorFlow which are called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) that are even faster than GPUs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Placeholder variables used to feed input into the graph.\n",
    "- Model variables that are going to be optimized so as to make the model perform better.\n",
    "- The model which is essentially just a mathematical function that calculates some output given the input in the placeholder variables and the model variables.\n",
    "- A cost measure that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.\n",
    "- An optimization method which updates the variables of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the TensorFlow graph may also contain various debugging statements e.g. for logging data to be displayed using TensorBoard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Placeholder variables\n",
    "Placeholder variables serve as the input to the graph that we may change each time we execute the graph. We call this feeding the placeholder variables and it is demonstrated further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we define the placeholder variable for the input images. This allows us to change the images that are input to the TensorFlow graph. This is a so-called tensor, which just means that it is a multi-dimensional vector or matrix. The data-type is set to float32 and the shape is set to `[None, img_size_flat]`, where None means that the tensor may hold an arbitrary number of images with each image being a vector of length `img_size_flat` (in our case it's 784)."
